Oduwacoin:2.0.0/IVIE
=====================================

Oduwacoin, the 1st Pan-African Open Source Cryptocurrency designed to empower minorities Worldwide

After three years of network operations, the developers of OduwaCoin have improved on-chain executions for its fungible currency.

The blockchain upgrade optimizes the Altcoin source code and Bitcoin core protocol backbone. Ivie will enable network improvement, staking algorithm, removal of bugs, optimized wallet, wallet user interface enhancements, HD wallet upgrade, fake stake vulnerability fix, greater stability, and much more within the Oduwa network, powered by its native cryptocurrency, OduwaCoin.

Oduwa Core network contributors find keeping its competitive culture alive as a non-correlative asset very important. This upgraded version will highlight a critical step in delivering blockchain applications directly connecting to real people, particularly those informed by the members’ community.

Stakers and node operators must update their clients to the latest Daemon Version. However, holders of OWC in their wallets or exchanges do not need to do anything for this upgrade.
