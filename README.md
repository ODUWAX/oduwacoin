Oduwacoin:2.0.0.2/EDOSA
=====================================

Oduwacoin, the first indigenous Pure-PoS Cryptocurrency designed to empower people of African descent.

After three years of network operations, the developers of OduwaCoin have come up with an improvement for on-chain executions for its fungible currency.

The blockchain upgrade is an optimization to the existing Altcoin source code and bitcoin core protocol backbone . Ivie will enable network improvement, staking algorithm, removal of bugs, optimized wallet, wallet user interface enhancements, HD wallet upgrade, fake stake vulnerability fix, greater stability, and much more within the Oduwa network, powered by its native cryptocurrency known as OduwaCoin.

Oduwa Core network contributors find it very important to keep its competitive culture alive as a non-correlative asset. This upgraded version will highlight a critical step in the journey to deliver blockchain applications that directly connect to real people, particularly those informed by the membersâ€™ community.

Stakers and node operators will need to update their clients to the latest Daemon Version. However, holders of OWC in their wallets or exchange do not need to do anything for this upgrade.
